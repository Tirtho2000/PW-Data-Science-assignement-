Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.Python is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum — which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming, such as: back end development, software development, data science, and writing system scripts (automation), among other uses.''')\n",

This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.Python uses a portion of the memory for internal use and non-object memory. Another part of the memory is used for Python object such as int, dict, list, etc. CPython contains the object allocator that allocates memory within the object area.''')\n",

    "Ans.-Indentation is mandatory in python to define the blocks of statements. It is preferred to use whitespaces instead of tabs to indent in python. Python uses four spaces as default indentation spaces.In Python, all the code that you type is arranged via correct whitespaces and therefore if at any instance you have a bad indentation, the overall code will not run and the interpreter will simply return an error function.t is necessary to do so for the interpreter to understand that it is in a loop or a condition.\n",
