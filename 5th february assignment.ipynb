    "Ans. In an object-oriented approach, the __init__ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor. Every time an object is created from a class, the __init__function is called. The __init__ method only allows the class to initialize the object's attributes. It is only used within classes.This method is called automatically whenever a new object of a class is created. This type of function is also known as the constructor function. A constructor function is a function that is called every time a new class object is created.\n"

    "The self parameter doesn’t have to be named “self,” as one can call it by any other name. However, the self parameter must always be the first parameter of any class function, regardless of the name chosen. So instead of self, one could use “Mine” or “Ours” or anything else."
